  A meditative interactive game I built for the e1999 festival at Keio University in Japan. “Ututu” is a Japanese word with many meanings and interpretations. It can be used to signify both dream and reality, but may also be understood as the path between the two.

The game uses the kanji character "ututu" as a guide through various black and white obstacles, leading to a moment of dynamic stillness.
