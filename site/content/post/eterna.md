  Eterna is a citizen science game that recruits players to design RNA molecules by solving puzzles. These designs are then synthesized in the lab and used for biomedical research.

I worked with the team at Stanford School of Medicine to launch *OpenTB*, a campaign to develop a new diagnostic device for tuberculosis through the game. Using RNA to detect active tuberculosis in blood samples could provide a fast, accurate, and open source method to help diagnose and treat TB patients. By analyzing, redesigning, and play-testing the game experience, we helped grow the player community to address this unique biomedical challenge.

In 2019 I had the opportunity to design a cover image for *PLOS Computational Biology* to accompany the paper *EternaBrain: Automated RNA design through move sets and strategies from an Internet-scale RNA videogame*. The paper details the development of an artificial neural network trained on Eterna players' moves.
